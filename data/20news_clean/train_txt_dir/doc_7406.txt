write hello let problem measure wave voltage digital use ac mode output value value right measure wave mode ac output equal value actually wave assume digital make kind input value wave period right use measure wave output output value previous one nature output value actually measure show re reading unless say measure probably average voltage input measure dc say measure measure average true wave want correct need either digital related question less important advantage digital compare one last significant advantage able see signal change time check anymore thank attention mail opinion open discussion appreciate either way power system laboratory phone office department electrical engineering phone home texas university fax college station usa internet jeff test equipment systems engineer
