send follow sorry let one easily change give year try also available ftp mac ibm reason general datum information people clear accurate say machine since computer technology always change always go point lack information please say also give clear information make need price us dollar keep datum organize please provide possible article information provide correct keep opinion general datum keep info provide simple understand talk explain finally keep information relevant section correct example os code rom software contain hardware support os disk software datum hardware section please thank note proper reading line document point special thanks andrew peter bell bill jon mark john lewis joseph park jeff robert provide information make list possible hardware monitor support expansion system os number note show motorola use mac machine example since apple never use motorola mac chip list year appear dead indicate first last year use cpu cache note ibm mac use cache external external cache increase speed cpu part present external cache ibm though machine generally sell install since many different external cache ibm scsi video disk different effect cpu performance machine ram cache cache card install expansion cache card go decide leave list note industry standard cpu bit ibm register external cpu cpu bus address cache note none none none mode none mode one one one double internal clock rate mhz mhz mhz plan code chip datum feature path speed chip external chip address ram low power power management use ibm cache add john far john know use ibm model neither two chip name basically cache improve speed ibm equivalent except cache chip run mhz rest machine run mhz pc week pc latest line chip pc sample release march machine announce least may pc week cpu system pc mac register external cpu cpu bus address cache note none limit code parallel processing two mode two two double internal clock rate development favor branch better target cache line equivalent capability speed include datum instruction code cache cache mac design create limit clock internal processor clock external bus clock one use rate chip motorola datum book produce program act clock chip program maybe write allow program take advantage future study one byte article show machine os program test representative general performance claim pc week ibm mac machine list eliminate motorola cpu chip register external cpu cpu bus address cache note int speed id low power system end high performance high end machine int id pc week pc select send sample chip motorola pc week board contain early sample give apple pc week pc week systems version pc week comparison list general rule motorola chip faster chip frequency chip higher frequency motorola even macintosh bible ed support comparison motorola chip vs chip datum address register limit mac bring lower chip otherwise compare hardware chip come hardware protect mode use windows use hardware nature put feature datum path comparison two chip protect memory present mac os use memory feature app system use feature protect ram disk create memory control panel support color hardware datum path make without use low cost solution people need program like two internal cache implement two cache one program like plan heat problem chip may cheaper pc week pc earlier release pc week pc week less produce degree pc port chip cpu line plan run program dos windows mac os top unix later os use necessary os shell dos hardware effort remove system almost every time add something requirement card driver video operate system ibm world microsoft hardware software work plug play standard pc week color mac mhz pixel clock standard present support use color color rom color allow almost capability display image bit color color color regardless monitor resolution color monitor type include vga monitor range include hardware video older machine support color ii color rom need software patch use color special keep cost speed mac bit display capability expand display color display change addition allow mac slot one monitor use two monitor show thing multiple monitor act one large large monitor degree picture video ram standard present mac video color provide run color display color display sound output standard mac since sound become standard ibm even though pc rom bio definition system video hardware use driver bio video see vga bio leave resolution video display hardware os program os video hardware question addition ibm never bother provide standard hardware mechanism software determine display mode actually present like mac result os must well write detect mode especially third party card use present thing program os print driver monitor card picture regardless color mode os monitor one mac impossible ibm example one color picture monitor vga color dos still color one start later ibm machine graphic faster processor may sound card cd rom pc week display adapter original video mode graphic text color graphics color color bad eye graphics color color lower re version run color eye vga video graphics color color two use mode ibm mac color mhz pixel clock monitor use input signal graphics vga provide feature lack vga mode like vga computer common initial implementation ibm model vga standard way instead catch category group video card manufacturer use implementation scheme people debate effort make standard establish use unit thing still video either today resolution color common one since give color one bit per pixel usually much slow western digital base example fast base example like popular limit factor bus address mhz isa bus cpu look card window standard ibm standard graphic graphic function like fill hardware implementation video available today though model high end graphic usually speed graphic like graphics faster available come soon vga max resolution also mode graphic function time faster standard vga windows include line draw bit transfer area fill mask address way detect exist card multiple like mac may far away since resolution color fix ibm implement color company color ibm technical rate ensure free rock solid image reduce visual vga compatible monitor type mac section specific detail expansion mac ibm scsi external device expansion interface common mac ibm allow use device hard drive printer card expansion mac plus monitor main problem lot external device internal cause problem two scsi port scsus suppose end set cause problem either mac ibm device per scsus controller mb max transfer difference due software driver fast mode see detail device per scsus controller mode fully tend implement fast since require different controller interface hardware software transfer speed fast since use software driver hardware speed limit device sometimes call fast fast require software driver electronics still use port wide require different scsi port electronics software driver make expensive scsi interface mac scsi standard since plus even though apple develop scsus os scsi manager need take full advantage feature scsi interface result present mac use fast mac controller chip digital review though lack part hardware like wide port interface since mac require card use older due speed cpu june come wide fast port standard os scsi manager ibm scsi wide spread yet generally system except local bus adapter like mac use fast controller mac ibm exact scsus controller result add scsi mac memory expansion exception mac use simm memory expansion since plus simm use mac special make use feature simm type call simm use simm iii use new simm time use ibm mac complete memory check every memory location something seriously wrong simm mac boot give sound indicate problem since mac make manage memory datum path simm install pair set quadra eliminate new memory management setup allow memory upgrade one simm time simm size use memory across two simm result performance ram access apr printer modem interface standard monitor interface sound input present mac pd available present mac ii line operate cpu mhz put datum path byte cpu mhz bus design adapter one card use problem card slow put mac ii mhz bus clock cycle except series use even mac plus scsi support every possible expansion cpu mac ii back bus clock mode future card design instead old bus use parallel apple byte mode byte development cpu expansion handle either pd pd cpu card rocket allow use multiple processor time like two mac box able task process depend card software involve card need memory card type come ram simm card standard ibm memory expansion simm simm model mac like simm memory check different type memory board hd interface limit hard drive design lack development modify frequency run length limited use smaller hard drive ide
