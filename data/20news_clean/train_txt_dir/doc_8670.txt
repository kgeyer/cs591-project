launch service expect remain strong next three year second half predict demand basis prediction upon satellite demand supply particularly new datum compression technique appear double use exist one significant possible change market identify new launch vehicle include russian launch system predict long term purchase launch service look best trade launch service quality price russian new launch service prove capability service quality market release market report prior market past issue compare two difference number change consideration new datum compression technique reduce demand new physical orbit note prediction demand space base communication appear remain strong line make market grow demand service world wide service prevent space demand cable provide higher capability service point point establish link necessary install cable point network solution install large network distribute link cost million billion dollar service exist ground network structure satellite still offer cost effective solution new service require new region cheaper install small satellite link cost ten thousand dollar tie exist satellite network allow new satellite service keep demand high market grow well since demand grow point service become cost effective later install link handle increase traffic since datum transfer market still grow satellite market remain satellite also get longer current generation satellite get guarantee year service year service last generation satellite cut back launch demand satellite owner satellite launch longer last note year look like space market rather supply exist launch system near term annual commercial launch demand size satellite per year supply side capable launch size satellite year capable per year capable long march russia capable
