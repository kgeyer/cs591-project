post likely question information ripem program public key mail encryption faq ripem write maintain marc post variety newsgroup basis discussion specific ripem group new run world wide archive ripem information contain much anything available current version faq stuff month version fair amount new information stuff like also thing order hope soon disclaimer nothing faq consider legal advice anything one opinion want real legal advice talk real one experience law export regulation whatever area law question list question ripem get ripem ripem run machine ripem work rsa des like distribute key bad idea use algorithm standard like ripem public key look similar pgp simple way security ripem question answer ripem ripem yet complete useful implementation privacy mail ripem allow electronic mail four security facility provide protection message measure origin always see ripem write mark code public domain except rsa routine library call license rsa data security current version ripem current version macintosh port ripem get ripem ripem use library routine consider thus distribution person citizen canada without export license license obtain one likely grant unless rsa key exchange bit cipher change something des suggestion situation may change clinton office author request file law violate export code distribution usa canada personal request author ripem condition use ripem note public domain license include distribution read use ripem ripem available via anonymous ftp citizen cd read file info note ripem product rsa data security merely help distribute ripem well stuff home site open ftp user canada citizen find obtain access ftp cd read file binary many available addition full source ripem run machine probably already port unix next port macintosh include standard port rather nice port write author port expect help user ripem work probably easy clean effective interface depend though user guide include distribution discuss way use ripem many popular include code also include allow easy use ripem inside make new interface ripem create one distribution believe use secure may useful feel free post rsa rsa crypto system mean two different related key one encrypt one one may publish encryption public key keep private key anyone use public key encrypt message hold private key need note message send rsa normally des key real see des note provide protection message origin service implement message see like encrypt private key authority use public key message must come rsa name three man find lot rsa modern cryptography general ftp look information also may des des data encryption standard use crypto system rsa des use key encrypt message however des much faster rsa ripem use des rsa generate random key encrypt mail des use key encrypt key public rsa key include result letter allow des key des sometimes consider weak somewhat old use key length consider short modern standard however safe smaller large corporation government agency likely standard support cipher near future strong feeling become without early problem like message algorithm produce rsa data security provide secure secure possible reasonable amount produce different produce thus instead sign entire message private key message need sign also exchange directly example ripem public key include public key file party wish key via separate channel merely need exchange key sometimes use purpose example often use map input length bit datum describe include implementation recent suggestion may strong originally believe function use accept true privacy mail standard allow transfer electronic mail generate long period time work group expert describe document old ripem really complete implementation specify key ripem handle time addition plan distribute key remote user able send secure mail must know public key able message receive come must know public key important information accurate bad guy convince key fact send message read ripem allow three method key management central server distribute finger server file three describe ripem user guide part distribution none provide perfect security standard call key management addition feature ripem plan issue still exist bad idea use algorithm standard like issue consider standard process internet standard discussion section must meet method include standard address issue regard cover cryptography course mean question everyone interesting exchange use algorithm standard regard cryptography league programming freedom archive available via ftp file file algorithm rsa data security company technology public key hold rights follow foreign method public key method system method rsa method claim four cover know method public key cryptography two business rather related example person jim president license technology number company ibm dec motorola use product also file defend ripem originally create connection use library reason author desire see use cryptography however ball start roll people get interested decide carry ripem ftp site people start make ripem key contribute code ripem even win best application build award ripem public key look similar ripem public key begin cryptography describe various key first bunch character key may lot people key mean key similar class key generate program length pgp pgp another mail program call pretty good privacy pgp around longer ripem work somewhat pgp compatible ripem way though pgp also use rsa major difference pgp ripem pgp key management feature particularly user without direct network connection ripem thus greater work software pgp make attempt compatible anything ripem use library rsa routine come license allow use pgp use implementation rsa claim violation make use sell pgp canada without either license write see disclaimer see phil author pgp stop distribute legal action believe scheme happen seem little happen future pgp user guide fact live usa federal agency actually run pgp computer public want run software pgp pgp ripem send outside canada without export license however pgp already exist many ftp site europe place whether use pgp ripem whatever documentation pgp recommend read anyone interested issue unfortunately distribute program difficult find ftp site due concern stand privacy mail similar ripem use cipher rsa attempt avoid system write mark later write ripem distribution contrary belief many include claim enough cover cipher claim accept challenge reason really use anymore compatible ripem pgp stand internet mail describe find newsgroup faq exist yet entirely clear people use solution type order send ripem message one hope standard draft internet document exist matter trust information systems work version privacy mail general last hear mail user agent rather system test know much simple way security ripem may wish check post discuss obvious attack ripem security procedure risk ripem main weak area probably key distribution
