may fix problem note know work subject sun know get error link add eventually may want add variable since get add command otherwise may compile share thanks joe subject strange problem building client sun fix bug conflict way build library cause build client compile appear work solve problem use xt please contact local sun office request follow patch patch description patch use greg source patch use mit library develop fix make get around problem patch export subject compile use compile whole distribution get several fault run note first machine necessarily result performance increase certainly platform problem use method pass structure argument return function value part link function pass return error occur program include server manual use call structure pass include argument list standard pass reference really fix call yet support fix structure return also help problem either use use routine cause problem solve file need compile use include addition several function use return value call possibly involve collect subject io error run build try run server get error get interface configuration operation support server bug screen find run apparently work simple test run last line output piece interest difference like version version run work reason go back source run distribution try run make clean make sure everything get compile proper include file mouse subject problem compile older find miss define list distribute mention add line file older version compile however actually ever device reference remove subject problem compile server file find sun remove replace line file change earlier version copy another distribution subject problem use share library try run following result find even call procedure build share library sun remember need run root install library install run server client building install distribution need careful avoid link exist share library might distribute make sure set environment build installation go keep xterm program please note library must install program work else program must link mit note also program run part build attempt however use library install avoid error build pass subject program run xt bug external exist upon base document remove mit guarantee library apply document interface set point xt library link program jeff subject get around security hole security problem certain client xterm run install

path library bob version xterm xterm library xterm install prevent program build library specify relatively note may cause installation disk avoid problem subject get around security hole many system default permit anyone workstation session access directly less privacy issue perhaps start second session display check man page thanks art subject topic building program subject make program instead take advantage process capability generate build software particular system although specific release use help solve number configuration issue make large system fairly part process configuration file configuration file individual produce obvious several different version version different obtain information source release note man page include information use build file also contain useful information tape mark guide contain paper jim early version paul write useful explanation work use support system document available directory look postscript document version papers available email mail message body send help see system administration friend issue german reader expect june article make make direct application programmer need write article journal issue resource issue contain paul article work document full subject get version distribute release earlier version distribute release toolkit version along implementation configuration file real standard configuration file although current contribute software expect distribute export contain distribution pick without pick entire distribution version one subject program install system run run correct argument output system base run make use new compile program subject link xlib shape routine try compile certain program get follow link error routine actually part shape extension shape mit distribution allow window like sample server extension shape extension run server support server well many server support shape extension case display window anyway order use shape extension must link library distribution library associate include directory file many program use shape extension also compile without remove define probably compile older library john subject problem find sun run program write machine get error find see get sun library work apparently share function call compare handle put file function always use guarantee load routine normally call probably see error program normal program call anywhere may program use xt function never open connection server problem call xt function solution add call program function execute link program need xt function correct call may xlib program case remove link command necessary link library although certainly solve problem subject compile program new program work well try link current version get message several name change widget set addition file move mention release note case function really xt function part text widget xt subject topic programming problem subject program get select window manager control input focus transfer one window another order get program must ask window manager input focus must set call hint window manager application use something like following true window application base xt set resource true probably want case source start application resource input true certain window manager use sun also add resource default file use client true mostly dave sun subject figure window manager run tell whatever mechanism use case case care window manager run long thing manner case particular window manager know thing wrong check particular hint place window window manager problem may appropriate case may appropriate determine window manager run order take advantage specific add feature menu order give program add window manager function provide even miss surely lead future problem subject program available general program macintosh handle lot end development window system use platform additional development problem solve use application tool use exist application good application might look want test one little thing include simple program put window allow offer start point quick example example directory distribution xlib hello world example update version program use xlib call current post addition sample xt program show open multiple display catch display connection available subject work interface resource widget type variable code may something like int int wrong datum type widget machine single byte variable work properly problem come often use particular toolkit xt type position code assume int similar problem type actually short general safe use actual type resource appear widget man page subject work probably try use function application code use widget function parent widget change child function also use widget case child request change parent way application request change widget issue call set resource although result function call application code must use standard interface risk widget datum become xlib call avoid use change subject call like although various detail current implementation xt internal make difficult major reason call exist remain set resource new widget set base location instance resource change instance move happen widget child time define probably little advantage destroy old widget create new widget correct location desire resource set resource correctly majority work create new widget note possible toolkit david lewis faq
