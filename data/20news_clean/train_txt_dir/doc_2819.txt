subject write widget use resource value resource size value may larger size try use instead resource handle way subject memory yes plus patch copyright digital equipment corporation int widget char char else int result call cause widget char char else subject guarantee call order register although book demonstrate current implementation xt happen call procedure order register guarantee sequence document volume say order list widget application xt guarantee order general procedure think operate one another depend operate need single register call function necessary thanks subject actually destroy widget operate two pass order avoid leave datum structure mark widget actually destroy program return subject user use xt possible code look like clear control call block answer set one valid value yes answer code drop back widget client call int answer answer really answer answer really positive answer exit example might ask whether create file whether enter second wait user answer question answer return call function function look something like motif replace code create sort display question string button ok help equivalent int string widget char string int widget int context string string response answer response answer response answer context answer context context blow away box shell return answer support three button set call function user variable answer set user finally select one choice response client call widget client call int answer int client reason call switch case answer value break case answer break case answer break default return code back point answer need continue thanks dan code dan library subject determine name exist widget widget id need know name widget user later best use function work widget object still use use simple bit code want note depend widget internal datum structure necessarily future version xt include string widget widget widget work object return modify suggestion larry subject get error draw widget order get window xlib graphic within program draw area window get window associate widget window produce error window associate widget create part widget use window id null window create error describe necessary call attempt use window associate widget note window create call server may actually map yet also wait expose event window draw subject get error call error occur specify go edge screen want catch error deal take follow step avoid error make size want clear background use use copy window get event copy clean use image get one event copy clean member event structure tell part good get probably take lot memory thanks subject application tell run number program offer mode otherwise run straight mode way application determine run display attempt open connection server display display stuff else something else either string specify follow display otherwise char null case use value display set simply check existence display argument check display set environment neither subject make application necessary call every window application thing create single window large possible screen make child window window affect application need big possible screen case user window move within virtual widget similar code work application use top window long ignore device event display window big display screen parent window never worry int size replace real size screen particularly avoid server problem window larger want use map raise window go back normal keep get extra mouse event depend window manager work may may similar effect well addition note also widget support resource merely wish change without block event thanks andrew dan subject without hang parent program application unix process continue run close child child parent open connection display need immediately child process close widget close display information able exit parent make call cause file close thanks gordon greg subject make xt xlib call signal xlib xt protect section signal make call wrong time might function call already execute leave library state note standard point behavior signal signal call function signal problem specific xlib xt mention function may call may assume function call xlib xt function work around problem set later check work procedure event previously add note article journal example volume error thanks subject xlib sequence lose error may see error issue xlib request xlib error likely make call generate request xt xlib signal case subject xt program handle file input common need write xt program accept input user via connection file operate without block either connection file solution use open file use register input input call every time something file require program attention write input like xt work quickly return important use io system call input input read file although input write handle exception condition wish careful register input read disk file find function call even input actually work suppose input call file ready read new datum read disk file almost always ready read however back beginning read datum read result function almost always call every time around way get type expect add line beginning function test whether new datum return call frequently application may better use instead set procedure check file input dan subject button event widget use likely set window field event xt need order match widget receive event send event application use instead avoid server depend well widget write may able call action procedure order get effect want mark subject anything appear run simple program right map window draw however window ready draw actually appear screen application receive expose event draw generally appear see code like many program code appear window create map switch case expose expose event break note second problem xlib implementation set default graphic context correct color program previously include code note code use avoid assume black white relationship pixel color black white may may even black white also note actually use usually wrong thing program ignore user background also note run situation program draw right realize may yet appear subject difference screen screen screen xlib structure include information one monitor virtual monitor single display support server support several independent screen number unix unix unix etc screen second think index available screen particular display connection use obtain information particular screen application run two form one take screen one take display program use widget determine screen application run use single screen part may fact return screen display name subject use motif file compatible motif file inside however definition string conflict string class need work around project help set class toolkit widget available via anonymous ftp work build set class parallel class widget toolkit via anonymous ftp use model similar user interface support multiple look user interface sample application include document editor program interface thing class library write air force base air command available archive site motif library define class motif add application class also widget set work develop van base set university graphics research laboratory current source available source code example doug young program include widget include set class facility need motif application check export wave offer programmer use motif info product call apparently base toolkit multiple window system include pm windows sell fax implement interface file sun guide produce class set class toolkit intend use sun guide tool source version release also likely use reasonable alternative object interface thanks douglas george subject obtain language version part source distribution version tape version anonymous ftp study team nasa apparently work information call still begin stage documentation outside code source available call write ted support part available anonymous ftp language depend foreign function interface get work go scheme xlib part distribution version export version tape scheme provide interface xlib motif available via ftp motif eventually make available jet probably normal electronic means advance information obtain may respond time permit complete motif language many common system base part upon also include info systems engineering research corporation also mit although involve produce maintain people involve information available subject get window background set background pixel window client reason client create set background window free window keep background destroy sure window background pixel use clear region background color use read back pixel however action window suffer race condition dave sun note apply border feature protocol allow server free however want require server keep original pixel lot space save jim mit subject create window completely window easy get use window order create window mostly several choice shape extension first release offer easy way make window set shape window fit area window however server support extension method implement window particular server use plane support hardware note color index generally solution use large number window make application unit difficult final answer consider whether really need window able application window information draw separate color appear properly thanks mouse see also journal complete answer include code sample last option subject produce color value use may expect draw value black background black example produce white however draw operation work value colormap index color result colormap index actually point random unless actually fill many server black white often program take advantage break want color number color cell fill choose value want use simply switch two color take set background color graphic context color value draw red say result blue draw blue result red value colormap index red blue thanks chris ken subject every color show black make sure use bit red green blue field structure scale nothing forget scale use example color function perform correctly result color usually black thanks paul subject program get standard colormap program use get standard colormap work use property create standard colormap return one one already exist use order create standard colormap first mouse subject copy screen show initial mean server memory leave around whatever happen usually probably want clear first use function pixel whatever color want background use mask dave sun subject check whether window id valid program id window remote display want check whether window exist anything guarantee window still exist time get id time send event window otherwise send event without install error catch error indicate window longer exist scheme work except original window destroy id another window ken lee subject two application draw window yes server id window resource actually server bit client application know id resource almost server resource except private color cell share problem face window id multiple application simple way handle solve problem application run different machine first application create property put window id second application property whose name also know draw whatever want window note scheme work one instance first application run scheme subject mention question use window id remote display note also still need among application note also two process share window try use server connection one process child close connection server open connection mostly phil subject program work number application include handle virtual root window use return wrong child root general solution add code use application normally use screen function name description get root window even virtual root argument display screen root window client window display int window child int window root none int false root child int long window null child false char success root break return root david similar code version distribute file function provide code include file first run properly virtual subject keep window user window window manager window manager pay attention size hint application place window guarantee window manager listen try set size hint target size hope best subject keep window time rather application raise track event imagine conflict two program run sure way window appear top make window mean assume duty window want short period time menu short window thanks mouse subject make text easy way unless willing depend sort extension yet either possible play game colormap change color thanks mouse subject get xlib user xt support translation manager help get good way get xlib protocol provide enough support unless action actually take next see event server thus mean code implementation use get file connection use select something similar note many reference suggest use extend action indicate case interface execute first action compromise check second event determine whether action action thanks mouse subject render text xlib provide graphic capability leave graphic library choice want stay within protocol render text read back via hand whatever want put back server via specifically create write text create image via create image big enough handle sin sin render note careful implement lose bit algorithm base may fact better graphic package available also permit text display postscript although capable probably use font find printer addition enough access server install font create font letter application figure mouse eric ken lee toolkit software support render font one source example code brian smith another possibility use use convert request program alan post paint font implement method use font package alan set function text version recently release also export resource volume include information hp font server provide scale text subject reserve name place toolkit application protocol define use string name
