one person might talk another another fact exactly thing north america utility company require supply feed house work two since voltage drop house wiring find drop drop time power reach wall outlet especially end extension long circuit run number reason historical simple personal different people choose call slightly different number faq choose consistent call except actually say measure voltage bit ignore one thing might make little equipment show lower ie instead value imply device design operate properly voltage drop low voltage circuit neutral hot voltage circuit hot neutral keep motor intend run three often subject electrical service look like four wire involve supply main panel power three come utility wire come wire connect one long bar ground wire foundation sometimes water supply main water enter house watch action break often make sure third outlet connect ground wire normally carry current one wire white black white sometimes simply black neutral wire connect center nec distribution supply power connect ground one place often inside panel neutral ground connect anywhere else otherwise andor dangerous thing may happen one ground system home code require one ground connect together connect neutral common point still one ground system add additional ground connect house wiring contrary code add ground neutral usually bring separate main panel connect together ie

application neutral ground subject difference circuit design power circuit current safe level example trip protect wiring wall intend protect wiring supposedly indicate equipment cause fire contain strip design current rate value power circuit trip relatively fast sometimes problem motor large current motor circuit use one brand avoid trip look like trip must replace fairly device usually one spring contact position another contact current device rate value strip heat trip spring pull contact circuit tend take longer trip high trip quickly number time time trip throw circuit use take place damage contact thus use place switch unless list purpose neither limit current per dead short circuit cause hundred sometimes even thousand short period time often cause damage subject ca use statistics show panel higher risk cause fire panel usually due screw contact heat time wrong size install replace since install better connection mechanism risk fire less extremely high become conduct path result complete electrical panel service wiring fire electrical distribution house burn many particularly canada longer permit panel new installation nec permit new panel require special key specific size device certain large air require protection addition panel protect motor check unit usually large install motor installation instruction tell need one subject size wire use amp circuit use wire amp circuit use wire long run though use next larger size wire avoid voltage drop slightly expensive though work quick table normal situation go size foot run cable gang wire place heat easily list size start get application wire type subject number come two consideration voltage drop heat smaller wire higher resistance resistance higher wire heat voltage drop wiring former need andor wire use use larger wire long run neither effect significant short distance specific exception use smaller wire allow obvious one line try unless certain use fit one exception never go wrong use larger wire subject mean use describe size cable first number specify second number current carry wire remember usually extra ground wire mean two current carry wire plus ground wire usually black white ground wire sometimes white red instead circuit without neutral case usually red wire usually black red white ground wire usually carry neutral subject connector use wire thread use connect wire together connector trade name usually use lot wiring strip end wire inch together though need wire secure many different size wire check wire use correct size size wire connect together wire together pair finger use pair wire sometimes good idea result end make sure go properly people open end electrical tape probably good idea may tear usually bit wire expose outside wire instead tape connection subject circuit measure current current hot wire neutral wire current ground via path may short circuit ground lead person situation trip break circuit protect kind example touch hot neutral lead circuit part ground help current pass hot lead return via neutral lead keep happy two pair connection outlet one load line power feed must connect line side outlet protect load side use protect device thus whole string outlet cover single outlet subject use nec single outlet within space near anywhere else likely water exception outlet space many particular requirement protect outlet outlet outlet must protect floor outlet near door outside outlet must even require protection may want consider install anyway unless need see cost low outlet cost little cost bit higher canada risk factor ever get small child use outlet power tool water ever inside subject use generally use circuit safety risk use power equipment must run long period time good example sometimes trip people claim motor cause current trip note though trip real get lot trip reason check wiring decide break subject difference outlet situation use either outlet first device circuit install former generally prefer since quite expensive example cost model cost one major exception need protect branch circuit two circuit share common neutral wire circuit need unfortunately expensive cost range hundred dollar depend brand panel box must protect circuit say choice one outlet may want use box install second thought use large actually deep box thank install ensure one specific outlet protect really go trouble find first outlet circuit simply find first outlet anything protect whole circuit prefer install good idea use little ground fault protect come mark outlet figure outlet simply trip test button see outlet dead subject purpose ground outlet use electronics comment certain light turn without good ground connection intend failure within device generally case connect ground lead failure hot lead case ground lead conduct away possibly trip circuit process case ground short occur case live touch ground get course circuit use replace outlet nec never ground particular apply anything else expose consider touch ground nothing happen slightly ground get small resistance high case ground hold perfect path ground subject one many device one device rely guarantee one specific wire neutral hot particularly light shell neutral safety device want ground reference ie radio extension wide require wire outlet plug right way around want wide neutral one hot outlet hot screw screw neutral usually figure screw connect subject kind outlet need nec require least two amp small circuit require outlet must install point nec outlet every nec must least one outlet circuit outlet may feed outlet except room circuit addition require outlet within must protect nec feed circuit break hot side outlet one hot go outlet hot go lower outlet neutral connect outlet one screw carry another outlet neutral must remove outlet neutral connection fall cause neutral outlet subject must outlet switch must least one outlet addition outlet may light outlet must subject use brand name type wire sometimes call name use area ie inside wall side subject damage heat home wire almost wire several different category cable cable know cable ac fairly damage cable ac additional external protection cable location ac cable run similar member surface cable must keep least nec edge member cable protect injury protection take form outlet box end note canada suggest cable use protection illegal additional protection rule canadian code reasonable answer reference expose damage nec cable protect damage pass floor surface wall expose location foot floor ie use ac instead cable connection water wire protect canadian usually install outlet box wall use short length ac cable cable jump piece also sometimes use cable run close heat transfer means air space material cable shall support within every box hole consider support cable provide box cable violation permit proper support cable never edge also insist one cable per refer seem cable never similar finish cable protect run behind cable may run edge lower edge cable box small must end cable prevent force end sometimes good idea work shop unless cover solid wall place damage likely like back wall may require use use various type join provide wire service frequently use place wiring need special wire nec look like usually need short length wire ground see wiring section wire expose direct unless purpose many electrical code permit wire include cold air return space reason fire spread gas burn building wire permit many area canada appear use similar wire us except canadian wire usually include ac us degree note local code vary one item change often chicago code require different requirement home check local code especially anything wire table real table wire type application condition type nec ac expose direct earth service service subject use box nec permit use box cable reasoning simple cable box provide ground box use cable slightly different never permit cable ground however must still provide ground also require cable box advantage box minor even cable avoid make one ground connection sometimes cost little less hand box impact expose shop wiring box probably better subject box box box use connect wire together box must way later ie use box often sign installation may get subject install light general one replace subject first course one check circuit heart set install half may need run new wire back panel box well example older house wiring heat generate cause crack obvious bad result specifically mark high wire may find fact wiring already problem case replace device real concern include provide ground make sure box mount strong enough support weight heavy fan may need install new box specifically list purpose across make good support also available box hole mount special rule light heat install present fire provide installation provide box usually make make pair high cover yes foot long nec rule somewhat less require least sort rule also say one free air movement mean might local actually seem requirement make absolutely certain get ie blow later contain fairly large case directly usually limit unfortunately somewhat expensive older type use ensure use follow installation instruction location vary yet appear heat use appear legal approach subject mean light motor start usually mean neutral wire panel depend load one hot wire may end less respect ground situation destroy electronic equipment possibly start fire situation ie us require frame connect neutral happen contact electrical authority immediately come check problem note second sometimes normal motor neutral circuit main panel neutral usually show increase far longer one second case doubt get help subject power use get house three power three hot wire degree usually use large motor provide bit start motor hence cheaper likely circuit show hot ground two hot show difference normal common neutral circuit two hot circuit different voltage bring feed house usually expensive impossible equipment want run standard motor mount much cheaper buy new motor case possible run equipment power start unit use larger motor auto good solution motor size expensive big replace press book small shop article must note lose possible electrical use converter law guarantee subject better run motor make difference however difference amount power lose supply wiring thing equal motor lose time less power house wiring motor also mean loss less motor get speed smaller power loss lead longer motor life usually unless supply wire foot long subject circuit physical law hp equal give loss power factor usually best consider hp go need circuit motor possibly hp give factor hp like equipment manufacturer particular manufacturer general hp far possible give similar mean power measure motor stop turn load mention keep condition seconds trip otherwise motor draw far current compare motor compare motor find figure check always present subject convert two three older home frequently instead modern three safety ground usually ground wire neither nec permit install new anymore several different approach solve wiring back panel connect third new box nec cold water go main house ground point run third run ground back main panel install ground connect anything protection serve instead also protect possibly also two outlet protect outlet must connect together since connect real ground wiring fault case device connect outlet sure though ground plug connection via cable permit replace two three fill ground like compound permit nec subject sure outlet test button work sure nec say remember though local code may vary test button connect load side hot wire line side neutral wire press test button current show trip simple reliable test require real ground work trip press test button probably test button work something dangerous problem correct immediately instruction come specify ground wire must connect know say cause may old instruction perhaps device never test without ground wire connect hand grant device properly list application include outlet one call installation ground circuit surprise see agree nec require promise subject wire shop kind wiring need enough power device code specify stay circuit typical home shop use mean one circuit major power tool possibly one shop use least wire many power tool big motor big use amp nec though require standard mean equipment light either circuit share circuit rest house least two separate circuit idea want avoid situation still several thousand switch install lot outlet easier install beginning cut exist cable useful least two circuit point run shop time tool really want use box maybe even cable may object fly around high speed something go bit wrong note wiring rule area use work mean wiring must run along member ie possible shop circuit include circuit circuit large tool air circuit circuit use extension help unless rate high current extension safe straight length wire also much heat heat issue shop remove main panel probably install shop wiring young child may want panel switch possibly lock want install individual switch safe particular circuit make sure get one rate high enough example light switch able handle generate table buy switch instead finally note home shop hence nec requirement apply even know never use one shop outlet run next owner house might different idea note fine magazine often carry article shop wiring april one place start subject wiring need prepare use special wire protect wire special possibly use act lead wire generally via box must specifically list purpose contain appropriate location box subject water serious style box need course forget require detail vary suggest specific situation hint buy roll tape say power line inch wire place subject wiring instead wiring become quite popular use since time wiring number house fire longer permit new installation recommend even allow use new wiring house wiring wiring properly install safe wiring however installation cover bit theory behind potential problem make wiring safe main problem wiring know cold wiring expand cool contract go number cycle lose bit time make problem worse contact certain type resistance connection go cause heat still eventually wire may start get hot attach possibly even cause fire since people usually wiring move house build cover basic point safe wiring suggest consider purchase home wiring discover later check wiring follow thing outlet switch directly attach wiring rate device former safe somewhat expensive one wire properly connect least way around screw direction repeat screw make problem worse pay connection note wiring still often use main service cable terminal wire connection use terminal proper screw connection immediately sign connection damage wire need handle current canadian code require wire use must mark connect nec require wire connect together use special device tool material quite expensive unless tool connect wiring means short see show reasonable wiring properly strip wire consider purchase home wiring show problem one two believe consider wiring safe sign problem many place suggest look wrong use replace proper type use range per subject buy house generally good idea look house wiring well wiring show problem one two minor one believe consider wiring safe minor problem fix sign problem many place suggest look hint look obvious wiring include wiring either wall hot wiring identify neutral without proper mark ground outlet except hang proper switch neutral like certain wiring actually code one time sometimes reveal wiring may hide violation switch seem control nothing perhaps properly wiring wall switch shut group light control wall switch except really switch outlet location great number box without outlet box great number wire go wiring pass instead wall ground wire subject stuff old style wiring year since several different wiring style come go buy older home may stuff section describe old method wiring system likely call tube make individual wire run along side member use wire run member use tube make wire together tape since hot neutral run wiring tend rather neutral often run room hot wire tend run one next case neutral often hot wire see home build late comment people install pretty tend pretty good wire tend stand well see example quite good condition usually difficult install box small particularly difficult box either wiring change need special attention box entry sometimes neutral well hot circuit sometimes possible neutral without circuit building code permit wall contain connection exist new circuit modern wiring require outlet install system since tend pretty decent condition generally necessary replace simply watch circuit many case perfectly reasonable leave exist alone add new new circuit use modern technique cable first type see look much like cable last two stuff use install much like modern wiring major type see whole system fall touch cable similar problem stuff become rather wire become wiring leave much possible opportunity replace simple switch turn several hour long fight electrical tape wiring technique modern almost often bit stuff stand well present easy work need replace consider safe modern stuff wire abuse much subject buy stuff try find proper electrical supply outlet near price often better hardware store better quality material variety include stuff people behind
