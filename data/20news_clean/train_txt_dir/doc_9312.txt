however tell nothing number handgun vancouver count handgun part difficult obtain handgun protection figure handgun new york city new york daily news compare two method suggest handgun per population new york city compare vancouver mean vancouver greater weapon new york city second method measure gun gun index previously measure difference theory normally second opinion seek different doctor index base average firearm homicide author basically take measure gun homicide seattle vancouver related gun homicide plus two seattle vancouver author measure relative ability firearm handgun seattle vancouver author law washington canada mention significant fact washington wait period background check prior purchase handgun exist canadian law carry handgun personal protection author also make appear difficult get handgun canada actually case author ignore factor might explain difference crime rate beyond mention provide law estimate one particular offense homicide involve firearm measure difference number law enforcement officer make gun law violation two rate rate actual sentence crime violent crime without gun gun law violation rate social scientist attempt measure hold difference

statistics like real problem demonstrate recent entry long line scientific research show link gun homicide fund federal government publish last year new journal medicine study compare homicide rate seattle vancouver suggest handgun ban may reduce rate homicide community medical doctor publish handgun crime homicide essentially reason three step despite many historical social vancouver lower homicide rate gun regulation make gun less available second step reasoning seem overall homicide rate seattle period per compare vancouver homicide definitely common seattle question become author present although entirely accurate case support claim third step reasoning vancouver handgun regulation much evidence difference gun indeed direct evidence point exist offer two datum support claim gun available seattle anybody know matter fact true therefore ask conclusion study believe difference gun explain difference homicide rate difference gun establish indeed situation even first two bit evidence difference number weapon permit issue seattle number permit issue vancouver difference two city permit regulation render two number second bit evidence gun index stand percent seattle percent vancouver index however measure relative gun various city measure gun average homicide involve firearm present case index show homicide firearm likely use vancouver take index measure general firearm must assume gun homicide directly related relative general population exactly author seek prove assume one seek prove prove basis assumption scientific evidence anything even grant basis evidence gun less common vancouver might still question cause author seattle higher crime rate higher rate gun might well argue low crime homicide rate reduce average citizen obtain gun word crime rate explain gun fact argue great low rate violent crime function nation gun law low rate gun british find great enjoy low rate violent crime many firearm control cause problem study end lack direct datum gun author say seattle vancouver similar many way imply gun crime rate attempt establish condition sound scientific analysis else equal among thing compare clearly two city similar way closer look reveal difference way relevant crime homicide rate city match population white percent percent seattle percent black vancouver less percent vancouver minority population although author show two city half available show relevant source rule fact difference two city particularly relevant light study homicide rate accord race victim white majority homicide rate nearly per seattle vancouver overall homicide rate two city therefore due entirely different rate among minority black observe difference homicide rate render comparison higher seattle vancouver minority much likely victim homicide seattle vancouver white majority likely either city since nearly initial difference homicide city due difference minority group fair ask difference gun matter minority matter gun explain black much likely kill seattle vancouver study united states show large consistent difference gun explanation canadian american rate among minority anything relative rate drug abuse among minority population city seattle run man west among young man united states usually percent canadian point canada united states many way city population two country analysis nearly many way might explain part difference homicide rate comparison seattle vancouver else equal author study pattern homicide result complex picture seriously main argument also status probably important factor comparison remark black vancouver slightly higher mean rest vancouver population give evidence present article possible difference homicide rate seattle vancouver result greater among seattle minority author pay attention possibility since information accord race available vancouver study sort simple example one take compare term gun crime homicide rate one find pattern gun less crime one conclude evidence alone gun actually reduce crime one insist variable also take account example variable city size gun common small town area crime problem fail variable lack appropriate datum examine possible seriously study hand author match two city size minority rate variable result impossible interpret firearm call science study two official disease control author apply scientific method problem public attempt draw conclusion research scientific method alternative explanation result try rule effort result may well seem scientific little serious research study one number recent effort research design publish lead
