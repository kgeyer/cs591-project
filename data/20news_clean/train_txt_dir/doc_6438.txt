chris write someone back look way document file think solution software company name east south software package file cost package price think key less character char give call ask free disk disk file char less key break cipher cipher something like call cipher key long english following discover length key count see try count byte equal two use key something byte equal use different key less equal assume random byte key cover normal text indicate equal key length repeat key shift text length remove key leave text since english bit real information per byte stream text together bit info per byte provide choose fact one stream text bit per byte key short might even easier treat standard old text show break possible method hand expert ten time much text key see example send mail unix pgp ripem

since program use secret key algorithm encrypt body message pgp use idea ripem use des rsa encrypt message key able although repeat call understand format algorithm choice available time far know unix command secure see program available call use attack file encrypt one source use compression encryption number people propose perfect compression follow simple encryption method repeat key unfortunately perfectly know exact distribution possible input purpose impossible describe typical english text beyond frequency build model input slightly accurate model able find output note nearly compression scheme unless design cryptography mind produce output actually start high example output unix begin number serve enter say compression encryption bad idea means remove need strong encryption compression encryption cipher yes see part unfortunately require secure distribution much key material course need useful rather need strong enough attack likely whatever length time datum protect expect remain valid random mean cryptography application demand much number application source bit random must impossible predict random bit give complete knowledge algorithm hardware generate stream sequence bit source software also know function expand truly random longer string apparently random bit must large enough guess also truly random perhaps generate hardware random number source workstation example generate random number use audio input device source connect anything example give file high random much one encrypt file use part key example convert string look hardware device provide important really measure rather assume look human must random example disk operation time sound like might many people disk much like clock output time relatively low point distance see distance amount real information source text encryption key equal number bit use longer show probably use back claim likely multiple valid therefore gain security choose correct one distance like measure make prediction rather give result amount likely single possible key try work normally deal distance instead directly determine event interest let distance cipher character character enough information real key set possible key des distance character less block block character may seem low first distance give work require find key character fact actual proceed along line use discuss distance like measure key size distance something guarantee small guarantee security high absolutely analysis manner might serve enter crack cipher message however similar consideration useful example determine recommend key change particular also variety test help guide analysis direction unfortunately application information statistics remain even work alan see possibility see key management important one cryptography full detail general system lack specific key datum encryption course one assume make tell probably find anyway repeat use amount key provide eventually thus especially modern communication system amount information transfer party must sound also enough key material cover traffic key management refer distribution key example modern key management technology iii secure telephone unit use individual code crypto central key management center operate nsa certain use control individual traffic key perform function lose give key management problem system several related issue many trust use number key stream produce relatively perhaps example sequence one popular type random number obvious output unfortunately sequence high enough show regular structure easy structure make interesting picture strong sequence structure see exercise correct frequency list english letter three answer question slightly one find first answer various book frequency list directly certain sample english text course list correctly exactly list get depend sample take second answer question make sense mean english letter english language fix close object exactly change time different different author particular message different statistics language whole third answer yes particular message go exactly english general reasonable use matter fact entire field call statistics method study question like chance text letter frequency english come answer make list sample english text good enough work use properly project datum security look source information german code break british see card card special case value use random function possible output process likely need random function produce distribute random give function follow code assume length swap value two address give swap achieve exactly simple since may although case error small cover case one take call number return value less go back get another value encrypt someone frequently express desire
