sun post still rather likely question information ripem program public key mail encryption faq ripem write maintain marc post variety newsgroup basis discussion specific ripem group month post attempt standard faq allow easy document world wide let know think disclaimer nothing faq consider legal advice anything one person opinion want real legal advice talk real question answer ripem ripem program perform privacy mail use technique rsa des allow electronic mail property send privacy nobody read except ripem write mark code public domain except rsa routine library call license rsa data security get ripem ripem contain library routine consider thus distribution people citizen canada therefore follow request quote file export code distribution usa canada personal request author ripem condition use ripem note public domain license include distribution read use ripem best way get ask friend copy since reduce load site carry mention human run require trust friend ripem available via anonymous ftp citizen cd read file info last look site contain source contain compile binary nice mac version ripem well stuff home site open ftp user canada citizen find obtain access ftp cd read file binary many available addition full source ripem run machine probably already port unix next port macintosh include standard port rather nice port write author port expect help user ripem work probably easy clean effective interface depend though user guide include distribution discuss way use ripem many popular include code also include allow easy use ripem inside make new interface ripem create one distribution believe use secure may useful feel free post rsa rsa crypto system mean two different related key one encrypt one one may publish encryption public key keep private key anyone use public key encrypt message hold private key need note message send rsa normally des key real message see des note provide privacy message see like encrypt private key use public key message must come rsa name three man find rsa ftp look look des des data encryption standard use crypto system rsa des use key encrypt message however des much faster rsa ripem use des rsa generate random key encrypt mail des use key encrypt key public rsa key include result letter allow des key des sometimes consider weak somewhat old use key length consider short modern standard however safe smaller large corporation government agency unlikely future ripem cipher possibly use multiple encryption des ripem relate privacy mail system allow easy transfer electronic mail describe document old ripem really complete implementation specify key ripem handle time addition plan distribute key remote user able send secure mail must know public key able message receive come must know public key important information accurate bad guy convince key fact send message read ripem allow three method key management central server distribute finger server file three describe ripem user guide part distribution none provide perfect security ripem public key look similar ripem public key begin describe various key first bunch character key may lot people key mean key similar class key generate program length like message algorithm produce rsa data security provide secure secure possible reasonable amount produce different produce thus instead sign entire message private key message need sign sometimes use purpose example often use map input length bit datum describe include implementation pgp pgp another mail program call pretty good privacy pgp around longer ripem work somewhat pgp compatible ripem way though pgp also use rsa major difference pgp ripem pgp key management feature particularly user without direct network connection ripem thus greater work software pgp make attempt compatible anything pgp fact pgp compatible pgp ripem use library rsa routine rsa data security come license allow use pgp use implementation rsa license thus hold rsa algorithm claim make use sell pgp canada pgp original author phil say documentation fact live usa federal agency actually run pgp computer public want run software pgp pgp ripem send outside canada however pgp already exist many ftp site europe place whether use pgp ripem whatever documentation pgp recommend read anyone interested issue note fact regard export restriction somewhat many people think way people interpret various document unfortunately discussion net seem produce heat light probably belong see disclaimer stand privacy mail similar ripem use cipher rsa attempt avoid rsa write mark author ripem distribution contrary belief many include public key claim enough cover cipher whose rest product large rsa claim accept means challenge reason really use anymore compatible ripem pgp stand internet mail describe find newsgroup yet entirely clear people use solution type order send ripem message one hope standard draft internet document exist matter simple way security ripem may wish check post discuss obvious attack ripem security procedure risk ripem main weak area probably key distribution
