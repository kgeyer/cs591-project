one question throw guy class project need design build power supply follow spec current limit voltage must stay within value ac less course use voltage chip problem current limit find stuff rest part circuit supply must present load draw give supply voltage reduce voltage current equal one amp thus short thing read one amp measure current read one amp output voltage must basic idea see current involve circuit pull current base output power therefore reduce output anybody idea work thanks advance andy anybody want flame stupid project agree fully still
