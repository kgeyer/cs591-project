cause update property window manager rely upon string appear window solution easy xterm run shell echo escape key text string wish display character change current work directory change directory cd echo string indicate xterm change title window change title name use use instead use change name note another way prevent display local directory modify cd use escape sequence note ibm may necessary begin sequence subject find xterm control sequence best source information source file postscript version volume user guide include version control sequence standard volume available motif version book available current guide include version control sequence good source information include version document also file source call put together list sequence date fairly accurate version publish manual last update subject xterm et al fail server subject use character xterm order use special character need also use font xterm font xterm family example addition may want set shell give character determine key use find equivalent character try use man example section character thanks greg stephen subject xterm menu small probably set small give resource like xterm ask widget xterm set main window ok use character size menu pixel show small set terminal widget specify name xterm subject print current xterm execute command however program richard specifically help primary find primary print command place menu also permit setting property version export also available subject xt use environment variable load resource use several environment variable control resource load program environment variable control xt look file application xt load one file path define another path define set software install system way file appear several different directory suppose example run sun open windows also application install set value like cause xt look file value environment variable list contain character follow see value application class name value file type case string resource none language language part territory part display language string part display language string let take example suppose application class name also suppose open windows install notice example mean mean application xt try open file order show soon find one read use stop look effect path search first let consider another example time let set look file current work directory directory first path list expand second expand setting follow name file application source directory run application directory work still resource load properly note look file reason neither type file define another may specify resource value example might run application like color one value expand character take value resource default compile xt note site replace default setting default also compile xt root root root root root root root either value user home directory set set value default xt ignore notice quick way make application find file current work directory set single work many people set value follow thanks subject put picture behind window answer lie change resource file run program change background load resource example file may add line false permit access display also file something connection along line argument display load display note general use window client thanks subject path set run file run source file set path normally place statement separate file source file shell configuration file set path file normal place make path set simply make start file work also try start path path echo path export path subject keep display another machine several way avoid display another unix machine run one solution use tape include start application remote machine start local xterm run remote machine recent version export one solution use program mouse ftp version program package term display single string stuff term term normally remote machine contain program check term special format recognize command environment variable addition need start remote process another host find host display display simple display must real version use start remote process equivalent host xterm start process another host date dec gmt chris host display display improve version suggest john keith put leave best case echo host case shell host shift host host term xterm display host shift host host export term display export display export path path export path subject design font one way use client sun tool design individual character large amount format see article journal information area contain number useful utility include convert font format simple character format text editor easier way use client modify exist font version tape available anonymous ftp de possibly file produce font compile variety server client group permit creation font binary common machine addition source old xlib implementation place export user use distribution convert font format distribution package include font editor number utility font format resource issue contain article use tool modify font font new version subject add font server work build font use system install directory run system equivalent directory sure use add full server directory already path use new font directory actually find last step probably leave also use make sure directory path sometimes command fail error error fail request range operation major fail request mean server find read font

command shell server terminal manage directory really font directory run mit server variety vendor server look directory file find file run run look file find run site people run server run server font format example make sure font directory right server use hint directory contain andor file work open windows directory contain andor file work thanks mouse subject convert font back font tool call part package available subject general method get font format mouse one solution connect server produce file font server willing let use converter require access server understand font file thus less powerful tool available via mail addition program produce font server access subject use font server font exist installation rule use font use application standard mit font similar size pick file file standard mit server also serve start point create similar file open windows server server use mit font scheme subject add font server format font prefer dec server format produce compile format format use dec note dec server also use font performance hit subject set default file want able something like resource screen write string converter impossible since accept file format therefore
