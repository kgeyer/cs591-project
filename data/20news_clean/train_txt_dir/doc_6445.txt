cipher mean cipher encrypt block datum byte say go next block product cipher due example modern product cipher include des cipher class product cipher operate one half round swap half round des example cipher follow table compare main several product cipher cipher block length key bit number round des make product cipher secure nobody know prove product cipher completely secure practice one begin demonstrate cipher look highly random example cipher must must produce depend every bit key show least round des require guarantee sense product cipher act mix function key complex fix product cipher refer example des product cipher reduce careful design list design des apply general may find brown et property product cipher let product cipher map block block let encryption key map send set block set call group write collection range possible key random expect generate large show simple product cipher generate group give sufficient number round group half group even write even number
