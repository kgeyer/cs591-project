use reduce noise small chip load clock line design use design rule thought help much output still large load signal line ground return still get ground power line help lot load high load clock line try really high frequency forget large area since time large make put lot hole allow contact forget exactly wide line design probably use solid instead use high resistance ignore speed probably better try circuit run slightly edge lower voltage especially output spend chip area space die since circuit big chip next size twice big need kevin kevin due light end turn
