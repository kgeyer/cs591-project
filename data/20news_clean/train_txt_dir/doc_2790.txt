give two entry pick entry something interesting run try avoid limit rule leave contest open rule interpretation real life programming interpret requirement document customer request important reason often award worst abuse rule entry point way plan abuse rule suggest let know remark section please note abuse break come byte size limit also abuse entry format tend realize hole rule entry attempt award worst abuse rule plug hole next year even attempt use plug need smaller check program sure work sometimes make effort entry problem particularly near final round hand see best entry fall work tend look number printer claim number bug better document note entry sometimes print power mistake save entry sometimes strange even help entry course correctly work entry best like mass source become old tend see mass due test apply simply abuse go far program well round many follow code define expect turn int use type int suggest compile entry must use must avoid area result error unfortunately require index type thus follow longer allow int char use instead string use string instead entry use function variable number argument careful systems implement wide variety way number operation use must use variable variable variable variable pass variable function expect pass variable function expect perform variable use structure particular treat variable char avoid use use instead use lead must first character line allow lead many exit function return system entry must assume return int small program best short program complex winner serve useful purpose often program people attempt completely understand reason look program one line program short one line program say around byte long get close byte bit long opinion tend program hardware specific os version specific difference ok specific code likely warning ok warn remark item compile abuse build file get around size limit use longer need similar previous winner previous unless space unless enter best one category suggest format program way simply form long line build file use try get around size limit one thing make use several help quite another use byte order try source size limit feel free make use build file space better show amount allow certain case impact program size certain point want get away source simply character give two version program one code format like typical program tend favor second version course third version program format interesting andor way definitely win first two suggest avoid try program many different size claim nothing wrong program fact number winner might want avoid claim know smaller one client entry possible entry wide collection environment favor depend particular type display example depend color give size require store client entry avoid use related library

program end build file assume source compile entry win source binary avoid tradition use name entry title follow case name conflict entry somehow win least likely win award use entry depend require build source andor binary file particular name please say remark section case apply helpful one following tell change entry build file make copy file example need special binary need special source need special build build assume use entry title send version file use name file datum section entry need modify source info binary file please say remark section try avoid original build source binary file make copy file intend modify allow people entry remember entry may build without build file build line build file must exist say remark section entry need special info file info section case multiple info file use multiple info section info file need info section info file intend input detail information fit well remark section example entry implement might want provide sample program user compile entry might want include design document might appropriate hint file info file use entry example info file may provide sample input information entry entry require exist case info file might avoid name conflict info file reason say remark section info file must current directory absolutely must move say remark section submit multiple entry sure entry entry number first entry entry number exception text outside entry format may ignore place text outside entry expect judge see tool need tell something put remark section send email judge apple sun address submit entry date give respect system refer gmt format date return example string apr format similar output date command string include name year many system one follow command produce similar string date date date date date allow entry set fix line entry section instead sure use title entry number well use determine entry replace process entry judge larry entry individual directory email message individual file contain entry section author section info section build section program section text include email message prior judge text file sure contain useful information case entry correctly information author section read judge process complete entry win award process help keep bias one particular individual usually keep much final award give like surprise end win attempt keep entry anonymous unless win award main win announce make attempt send remove file related paper tradition even reveal number entry receive curious indicate volume paper present winner talk attempt send email author win entry one reason give author chance comment way present entry give chance correct mistake often accept remark well prior post winner wide world judge number round round collection entry two equal advance next

perform number source pass source shipping file later round action perform source source run program perform test source binary reduce entry entry entry judge individual basis entry set aside opinion meet standard establish round number entry entry begin form award category entry begin award entry often several category actual award category list vary depend type entry receive typical category list might best small one line program best small program source useful program best game program code best client see best abuse worst abuse rule anything else strange deserve award limit list example entry winner start final round award category necessary final round process perform difficult task reduce remain entry winner often entry make final round definitely better one make winner final round less clear cut sometimes final round entry good enough win beat similar slightly better entry reason sometimes improve version entry fail win previous year assume course entry worth improve first place often select small entry usually one line entry entry abuse contest rule way end pick one entry best sometimes entry simply far entry often best pick well number category winner
