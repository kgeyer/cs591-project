file find file find resource use quite file find read next part describe various environment variable effect file find thanks follow use several environment variable control resource load program environment variable control xt look file application xt load one file path define another path define set software install system way file appear several different directory suppose example run sun open windows also application install set value like cause xt look file value environment variable list contain character follow see value application class name value file type case string resource

follow order execute library guarantee order widget writer application writer ability modify entire list neither one currently know guarantee order application programmer rely widget writer widget writer require document widget add remove list effect therefore contain independent contain list even though xt standard definition say specify list procedure may word routine call order add list know widget visible build widget need know visible set visible interest field window completely visible go false however window stay set true right everything implement correctly demonstrate protocol widget reflect capability protocol information available one way case way xt accurate second third section read section visible field change response event receive window go widget occur protocol state state specific meaning protocol see xlib protocol reference manual problem something else need see window manager window manager problem way determine window application writer keep track action routine translation shell widget contain widget widget writer see field return call suggestion widget xt use etc unfortunately code call tend ignore possibility return null best handle something like type type exit handle common case define function use standard language function execute null value return xt error suppose return exit addition call null use get initial space allow code like type type else type type count count write count also accept null argument generally find xt function use however anything large use standard function fully enough memory error structure copy string char char take care type interpretation reference manual allow implementation provide function free code char free may work personally call implementation complain vendor common error motif programmer use string really use xt application first get software great package memory problem sun bit still excuse contact info additional check instruction directly object code produce exist instruction check every memory read write perform program test detect several type access error read memory write past write free memory check logic code program include third party vendor library system call interface addition track memory identify individual memory use collection technique nearly memory access check slow target program factor two five alternative package sun run many unix pretty similar feature environment replace several library function add additional check contact info next get sort xlib error need run mode easily command line argument set variable set break point exit let back original xlib function call run mode actual error may occur number call xlib previously since xlib call buffer reply server next trouble window use resource class resource cause widget name identify window example example true example new window give normal information widget name class window include help check location size widget next trouble manager want test way widget manage child try act filter child manager check idea problem application execute keyboard mouse menu server lock need go another machine kill server lock application say one else access keyboard application stop wait wait command unfortunately give input go application stop best way kind problem two machine run program environment one machine run application possibly use command sequence like display application application set environment display run believe method deal call xlib function release widget problem require pretty good knowledge widget work go long way without know internal particular widget far without understand widget work use add print statement help great deal work get problem three routine problem use application seem properly make little everything work perfect real application nothing happen function routine see change happen use default application context different one may create since event distribute per application context basis use two application context get event example app class app never implement drop roger move datum client motif version support capability support along two protocol far know publish write package call design public protocol drop operation client provide tool make easy people support standard protocol program develop contribute sell regardless widget set use long base xt implementation base upon understanding detail read code hear people use like feel work whole lot better motif stuff also seem many think use motif anyway latest stuff available ftp possibly older version also available state university hall oh
