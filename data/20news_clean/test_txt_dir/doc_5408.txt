two soviet rocket space center new probe planet probe mean yet surface radar map planet detail orbit task basic design modify area central bus make one inch longer carry two require brake orbit double fuel carry year earlier extra solar panel add give vehicle power handle large amount datum create radar communication also make one larger properly information earth bus usually place install radar radar system possibly version satellite use earth able map surface resolution one two mile soviet probe united states reveal object smaller mile resolution similar observation make radio island examine region either appear contain number interesting feature investigation million million mile two fire brake rocket place orbit mile around planet complete one every hour follow four day later probe thus become first spacecraft radar operation begin minute every orbit north probe make radar surface mile wide thousand mile long head highest part orbit south battery datum back two large soviet earth strip information take hour process computer end main mission map million million mile percent entire planet reveal surface complex show late mountain plain spread across many apparently form last one billion year term make surface rather young hundred detect well create better term least mile across due soviet scientist origin certain surface feature example probe owner wide high mountain planet result impact american scientist hand feel proof huge sit event decide wait make radar probe schedule later originally name radar initial design scale back radar eventually machine call vehicle map entire planet even detail time however soviet probe maintain radar ability next radar measure world majority area cover register five hundred degree degree location two hundred degree possibly indicate current activity probe also find five three mile lower air mile five degree similar main mission end plan least one radar image surface unfortunately idea come pass may enough gas perform operation transmission march leave soviet institute electronics six hundred mile radar datum tape sort map year target scientist wish planet air professor french space agency national propose idea far back mission late year dream eventually come true two rocket send soviet provide western first clear full view launch every soviet probe since one many first complex mission probe launch space name word russian word spacecraft one mission perform also one objective make latest return region solar system since last visit since believe remain solar system five billion year ago scientist around world give high one body actually come close earth cold solar system like various force fall towards sun ice million solar soviet along european space agency institute space science wish miss first opportunity human history make close use probe make close first deep space view much distance scientist united states also desire study space probe one time power solar engine however government budget cut nasa american effort make observation datum nation though name mass design chicago university professor john add soviet mission may answer instead build entirely new mission decide modify bus design perform mission along way reach bus drop one use mass planet towards much probe use year earlier soviet head help location probe mile away march plan two arrive june release first day month make towards planet touch morning june mile surface small release produce mile thus first probe ever arrive one gas foot foot package properly know top part serve point electronics connect bottom measure paint special white finish keep bay planet drop night side north scientist concern gas heat place give much time possible return datum action come well remove camera system use previous mission author wonder though use similar one attach soviet scientist think planet surface due cover first hour right day battery fail cover mile threat day heat station drop mile consider active three main report indeed push across planet speed mile per hour strong bob two three hundred foot air average degree degree pressure earth find clear region early first flight already head towards surface similar one carry however become report ground site plain north still ten minute away cause begin program activity mile surface neither way shut general loss datum also fact cover plain never directly examine surface pressure degree degree earth minute ground transmission large amount background also record site camera fail focus datum return mass detect possibly possibly active give color gas find every air mile contain one datum overall structure appear information case make even fact result nearly match find two main instead three report probe three five mile mile like mile much lower reading one possibility may change air last year finally go last function part mission bus around sun become first probe meet march bus make pass travel space first mission two body one space june release fall towards like radio information back track earth hour battery failure morning side planet flight second enter rather still environment become less hour mission hour mission time air become even hour pass five mountain powerful pull mile towards surface report air move degree degree area pass level positive make either second fail function touch edge western arm june mile rest place think indicate either surface relatively young one cover work order report rock type know earth present rock rich lack high degree also present air around measure degree degree earth essentially typical day night far bus speed past distance mile follow make closer march mile probe help reveal mass mile across every hour give take three hour since still function soviet scientist consider option send probe object one target near earth pass distance six million million mile back opportunity become first nation fly spacecraft past discover enough fuel probe reach plan shut early future plan mission give scientist idea hope even second world sun one example mission plan early call launch multiple probe single rocket either first drop several probe design survive planet one month large two day mission head several include possible thus mission name main see earth unfortunately plan begin change soviet decide mission red planet instead keep aspect time soviet space program interest focus already entirely new probe design call two member class plan leave earth orbit next year place first moon even include probe sample return eventually human early century environment serious consideration human near future thing begin look soviet probe fail complete mission one lose contact way red planet go orbit one week plan moon march plan drop ten around planet several year later mission launch date move year put hold official soviet mission since put year planet late political economic change take soviet president begin open nation benefit increase rest nation particularly west culture become less past economy take ride also effect free market effect hit include space program mission level cut back begin make almost attempt nation either keep remain program alive make money early report offer sale several price million dollar low price probe nation take united states gear new mission launch space shuttle may shuttle spacecraft part probe design make complete history reach second world able map almost entire planet resolution foot ability another american probe launch space shuttle make quick way orbit planet shuttle release second probe space name discover probe primary target major moon powerful enough send direct flight planet probe send around earth several time build enough speed reach result become first goal february probe radio back image planet violent board success last year new plan lay talk space scientist former soviet independent states since effort launch new mission within next also consider mission next february nasa come several new project part program launch probe solar system two mission select study mission involve small probe one measure air pressure probe design study air aid much since final project decision make human human ever able stand surface present air pressure earth life protect something even plan look change environment something like earth however note require much major surface heat ability speed planet rate something bit faster every earth day project may take century effort make better understand exist today still yet fully know world similar earth many important way become instead place earth ever suffer perhaps hold answer answer may best find international include nation make first attempt senior editor research result university press andrew new solar system cambridge university press sky
