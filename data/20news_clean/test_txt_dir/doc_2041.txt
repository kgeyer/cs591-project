performance post compile art ram faster cpu disk space faster standard response hear ask improve performance workstation well hardware always option wonder hardware always even faq list collection suggestion idea different people net best possible performance windows workstation without purchase hardware performance highly issue individual user must speed feature order come personal decision therefore document expect contain many opinion objective fact document specifically concern course many factor affect performance workstation however outside document people seriously interested whole area system performance might want look system performance mike imho contain treatment system performance similar book ed table faq window manager server server lock server ram start server font file define display properly client better clock better terminal client pretty mouse programming say source information author note change since last issue new since last issue document post month around

question document focus general information faq performance faq address issue speed regard server topic seem use faster please see faq complete detail window manager lot window manager lot different feature ability choice use act performance useful feature point agree upon best window manager couple try window turn thing like move also lay window manner reduce amount cpu power spend raise lower window joe english find good font biggest font know use sun screen still get two terminal window display font suggestion accept server server make sure server proper match hardware monitor use server sun notice much difference server however point smaller therefore contribute less thanks michael server compile also make difference jeff law sun system compile version sun expect get large server use assume similar result occur use one commercial market lock server ram anyone try server lock ram get page via call help performance one topic function call hard evidence someone try position give try thanks eric start server joe english start lot client whatever sleep second two launch one change actually take less time system without much though sound work provide good explanation work start server take huge amount time start accept connection lot server start process touch large number page process run time fight server use cpu memory put sleep give server chance get sort client start also lot client program start toolkit register widget resource program state database activity memory process reach state memory use page use sleep client avoid fight workstation limited resource definitely may vary situation many variable consider available ram local swap space load average number user system client start currently situation like sleep sleep sleep xterm sleep xterm experiment sleep sleep sleep xterm sleep xterm even try sleep sleep sleep sleep xterm sleep xterm idea last one make sure completely finish processing state sleep client launch fairly result stick current setup probably experiment bit find setup load font take time ram number font application use get speed increase time one simple choose small number font one small one large one whatever client least use client use font client program start font already load server also server resource since font load server joe english main xterm font also set use menu default font since normally use eliminate one font server keep font local workstation rather load make use font use font server file keep file small save ram save server time joe english one suggestion file try put number resource want available application example true separate resource individual resource file example file set environment variable frequently ask question faq contain excellent explanation environment variable work ed xterm launch load resource find note client follow pattern check system directory often find proper name name personal resource file name document xt thanks kevin michael mike long kevin willing mail setup file method organize personal resource follow benefit easier maintain resource store server property side benefit server may start since load resource application process resource never sort resource find one affect also application interested load additional file every time start seem make much performance difference might consider huge modify application resource database need application without default run file resource multiple resource file load individual client program watch style comment file strip switch method distribute resource file spend several day try figure client find resource xt provide error message style comment resource file simply process resource file loss color enough cause people method resource management may also run client break rule example neither find resource anywhere start client machine share file machine resource store client find resource load resource server guarantee client always find resource possible compromise suggestion plan try put resource use client xterm file use separate resource file method client use define display properly client program often execute machine server situation rather set display environment variable name workstation set display variable unix access routine know server machine use memory method transfer request thanks patrick see display section man page explanation properly set display name think mit least data general hp library enough use local communication even display set rob send xlib patch change use local communication even display properly set want get business distribute try patch include mit apply minor line patch want try email ed client ram think number program run think also kind program run example smaller clock program unfortunately really notice program large research spread word suggestion better alternative standard client xterm welcome ed receive advice people subject client program use program xlib base since xt toolkit rather large warn application use may already load one share library case use example client program may actually increase amount ram seem mix toolkit try use client client motif client etc use one one toolkit library know environment think client program work best together environment thanks rob better clock suggest available display clock title bar another program save screen real suggest mouse available make look much like mit mostly like change resource course clock one resource take screen real one hang wall better terminal file distribute xterm hope enter program distribution maybe site still use suspect xterm one client many site better terminal available see must use xterm try reduce number reduce memory suggest richard available need feature xterm get hold write save swap space xterm rather write xterm resource xterm current version key xterm hear version feature find yet update march recently email conversation brian regard question whether really faster xterm instance may slightly faster compare speed try see program faster also xterm may slightly larger ram requirement hard number anyone else share library share text mean xterm requirement major experiment stuff xterm make little difference since never use never get bring memory stand conflict report xterm summary may vary provide hard datum like see specifically much ram much swap need relative speed suggest mouse available also terminal major lack people like anyway client suggestion client program work faster scott come suggestion regard motif text field widget notice datum entry motif text field widget get response particularly initial one field examine go find seem resource focus text field widget even text widget every time appear widget widget code make request server user stop set resource make little difference system specific suggestion probably apply general lot area consider use client minor turn save server request pretty use large gif etc root window background root window server screen window etc take ram cpu power work sun performance issue see people sun run root window let someone else figure much ram full screen root image workstation anything like need screen real get client see root window anyway thanks remind one ed mouse use fast move screen move mouse use file let send across screen see man page idea information hint sometimes may want slow mouse fine work cover option place number different mouse setting command menu window manager menu mouse setting mouse setting fast normal fast system default default program thought joe english speed application develop thing stick motif program set resource individual button list et use whatever resource manager widget stick font possible better yet use motif absolute create destroy widget fly try avoid many problem toolkit use line server make huge difference multiple expose event make difference fast application completely one small remark hear use better function greatly increase performance xt base application since use suggest try find time yet test small program free difference indeed somewhat time faster anyone ed event people use routine forget use cause event every case put load onto connection force client run thousand request context also see one create change xt use definitely better mechanism share lot need remove load request connection move toward client say propose idea seem right wall first david lewis day night swap display someone else run program machine display user run machine onto display goal reduce context switch operation client server situation easily try receive follow michael run program machine notice big difference try run machine reduce net usually nice reduce impact help lot poor little mb mb server client cpu server run machine really major problem except client server absolute context rely fact cpu mostly cpu chance something time small get twice cpu memory available action second factor context switch expensive use cpu half pay price due go network case improve network vs allow even context switch source information volume window system series window system guide book read lot performance paper application performance chris issue resource earlier version
