post week back get back error message deny mode interest set display variable think post solution try able type get xterm run difficult stuff take care theory program everything ever want want run

like original major work set also work rather maybe turn first look like turn point big code try way work mean assumption environment run assumption valid machine use environment time try make assumption possible remote machine list one remote machine remote shell make remote shell path compatible use pass remote machine need know eat must use run remote command simply hang wait file close rather use even call change variable domain name pattern match domain name must include lead include domain see code dc ac uk change value set variable think user make name remote shell command end variable doubt use home home home anything else close might stop due shift user die user shift pick host host die thing think remote machine seem trust user set right current host current host include domain comment next line know different display go danger heavy regular follow need extend support host unix require display display display display unix display display display come hard bit quote also quote quote quote quote thus bar get bar last xterm last last warn name nothing else become xterm special consideration side user want pass go appear number command line least work need ever fix code set display return server path path list display shift add else hate system really want pass value display display else variable wish export display shell user shell need give path rather pass current path might work machine rather set user remote shell program place problem check might run another shell shell know sound common round also include see easy way pass without late one person shell anyway oh yeah assume shell shell much important shell better shell push path routine local local unless define return unless return unless return return try find nice valid export unless export home try find somewhere nice live side test cd start build full command command side set use build remote command remote join remote remote remote build list remote print else return go side ok go wait around see happen end test echo wrong size end echo end archive miss test miss miss test miss echo archive else echo still need follow archive echo miss end shell archive exit real unix system
