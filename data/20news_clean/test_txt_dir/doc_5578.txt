five previously know range size mile across represent five moon cold show evidence past activity include ice moon surface feature high well plain suggest moon form another body event solar system contain many object impact large impact apparently material expose surface think ring image saturn ring ring make complete solar system investigation planet moon spacecraft within mile fly moon become clear planet active observe great spot size earth great red spot move almost mile per hour also note smaller spot well main highest speed planet observe mile per hour like planet planet contain higher rock gas blue like blue color due field relative planet center similar field suggest field two generate area pressure great assume electrical property earth field hand produce slightly relative center also light ring observation earth indicate material orbit around planet clear keep spread even ring detect fact part complete ring number small moon explain body spot identify moon find six one new moon actually larger since orbit close lose planet earth orbit six day force cause towards planet million year short time term moon close tear form ring planet current ring strange io moon rock saturn probably moon moon show two different type ice cap appear ice cap shoot gas mile earth carry ice cap surface yet find solar system degree degree might like object spacecraft far visit planet yet orbit carry inside orbit since remain march orbit also highly degree plane planet discover appear little planet mile size moon observation indicate surface cover ice may fall surface planet move away sun observation also show degree planet one satellite discover surface different moon appear cover rather ice orbit lock body always keep face period period earth day although spacecraft ever visit nasa currently possibility mission member solar system pay visit planet solar system beginning survive far sun object beyond planet reach perhaps star orbit new orbit carry close sun fall inside orbit planet element make time enter region planet element mile across make material similar moon planet material form head measure ten thousand across grow get closer sun stream charge come sun push blow back like give rise gas blow directly back push continue orbit leave behind gas point away sun effect sun reach million million mile length total amount material contain display fit mean essentially light show pass solar system orbit modify close one planet enter orbit return solar system example relatively short period return average every year orbit beyond within orbit go back regular solar system name plot orbit predict return base earlier law name become part return schedule unfortunately live see sky pass close earth unfortunately recent pass closer million million mile world visible eye especially southern visible interpret bad render sky spacecraft become first fly close remain approach sun observe become active grow begin element form several spacecraft fly high speed first nasa international five spacecraft two japanese two soviet spacecraft european space agency fly conclusion despite effort across distance space scientist past one body study earth since solar system neighbor space learn solar system member anyone previous thousand year spacecraft travel moon planet beyond world except observe moon large small planet fly sample solar environment book include picture body generation alive see strange place object knowledge gain solar system earth science like entirely new call study planet moon compare difference learn origin history body solar system whole also gain earth complex system see shape world sun activity solar system better understand condition process earth continue learn benefit spacecraft space one current mission map fly world reach
