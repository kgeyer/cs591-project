along motif move new motif open look feature add yes use instead news news dead mean dead support probably next release know source release environment include least sun port motif look manager least yes new frequently ask question post version last post version use go next topic subject open look motif subject window subject terminal subject configuration get start subject key cut subject application subject manager subject trouble strange error message subject trouble let type subject trouble use display subject trouble common problem subject trouble problem subject subject environment subject get ftp implementation subject book manual journal papers subject get file history recent change subject open look motif open look open look user interface determine look feel system shape window button thing file open look specify develop maintain sun see also environment open look user interface compatible window system mit well currently sun news program write system come sun also system release certain vendor sometimes also call program use start main call windows open look term either wrong apply something else source cost server plus another current version various platform sun see also mix get toolkit programmer use develop program open look see documentation individual toolkit summary open look toolkit window system use widget set probably people already programmer learn buy source although get version sun ship sun include library also often include system release write release support pass division replace note nature xt probably want need source order develop large application anything else use see technical conference sun toolkit write similar programmer interface even shell help source code often say toolkit learn familiar windows toolkit include full source available anonymous ftp current version sun despite contrary even within sun toolkit drop sun include next release news hand toolkit likely receive much attention sun future news toolkit programming system base postscript language news implement many open look interface component require build user interface application currently include current version sun release contain sun commit support least stop news support time later year replace display postscript might ask commit mean context answer seem mean absolutely nothing sun currently commit however user interface toolkit class library top tool generate code file also include feature event management use postscript color say compatible since release mention work official product project various people within sun find mit directory use binary mode motif fit motif alternative user interface develop look feel microsoft windows manager commercial motif toolkit available although motif source sell although motif currently available platform open look almost certainly use many machine simply sun large install base sun volume contain improve motif application convert also note table version let user choose motif open look feel part system release contact display postscript thing sun agree sun include extension next release essentially design top slow level postscript intend give small news use understand real advantage news manual much smaller generally less complete also available kind machine performance work like remain see note font share extension make type postscript font available program like pc regard least one version make font available however subject window window manager window manager part window system responsible decide lay window screen manage user window standard open look window manager include implementation also get source ftp since sun version manage virtual hence name show little map screen currently display area represent little move around key let run several client application move display around one scott need compile get ftp site directory three patch use window manager instead yes use example able use pin feature probably see window use display certain message use want use function menu get program button run put target target try add menu window manage menu menu menu left title bar window tell see manual page window manager etc subject terminal display use without terminal server news postscript mean run program compile system unfortunately mean program need either news support thus run terminal include particular use see terminal windows display open look client one work perfectly well may find get font find see section run window manager terminal may problem input focus set input true terminal file may may help subject configuration get start configuration file need know first time run file create directory home already exist might somewhat move old file another directory old new file site use use instead since look file file create home directory depend version use look normally file without lead copy want change may need get recognize terminal want run window xterm program system output direct instead write screen note execute unless put windows resource particular good idea include least true input true allow program receive input even forget ask program run select property default root menu write choice put comment since delete news user file read actually document news programming manual near back useful thing put postscript code change keyboard repeat rate although must careful since error postscript mean either start get break strange way news manual give code warning thing file work note mouse speed best set see man page man help information look like want third second repeat rate key per second repeat experiment bit key send thus include time process key probably higher want see news toolkit reference manual false begin note greatly end must also file directory like news pop force change test without server like welcome welcome send press also either two file make root window postscript background move window true put note may increase amount memory use news server see also trouble let type trouble easy way environment open look mouse keyboard use change mouse button prepare one two surprise see also man list change least program use set mouse let handle status return tell whether server run put else get screen go system run effective screen see man need copy older system supply add new file make system run subject key cut cut xterm program go xterm say select text want copy select mouse button xterm press copy xterm key manual get wrong move window press work see trouble cut go way xterm select text need use copy move xterm window press middle mouse button also use button available quick copy within etc select get text want copy text go press hold cut button select text want see cross appropriate go let go cut button text cross appear drop move select text want copy move multiple select mouse button put mouse anywhere within press hold select mouse button move mouse little right see change first letter text still hold select move mouse point want drop text may see mouse change target show ok drop thing let go select text move work text field box well text drop copy use drop move except must hold control key well select mouse button default key see man page general command go direction shift word delete word right point include file find start line back word end line forward word delete word delete line move document see reference manual list default key see also manual page put document see manual page subject application contact sun ask open look guide list page application also huge product update sun free contain version several popular open look application often simply contact vendor concern license upgrade receive full product documentation produce user printer contain driver variety printer well font license separate faq post list number free commercial mail copy include open look application list subject faster reply subject manager interface manager yes manual page man work give strange message see trouble strange error message signature include mail best way cd use whatever prefer add filter signature might need change home press signature file subject font support type postscript font yes either sure yet word utility tell font supply fully hint though compare microsoft windows apple font interesting font format describe sun group list documentation version also available sun buy font probably major software support type font font render time although sun type pretty fast fast load font size use lot also access font cache lot memory might want increase font cache size welcome say type line server use check see news programmer guide need say postscript package load see man page make font faster cd create char greater number character supply file directory want server see new font directory every time add directory environment variable one file convert font format also use font server convert format first use font another machine unless use say use generate file compile use distribution convert font format use either also use mouse get font run display server ftp font various text font available fact font scale well subject trouble strange error message manual entry man seem find command even though run try set environment variable export user system window window creation fail get new window base frame pass parent window environment create base frame process message come program earlier system network program still around name almost certainly want run program instead set path come get version memory fault get get follow patch trouble compile xt program use xt contact local sun office request follow patch patch use install patch add link line alternative add even subject trouble let type try type program get nothing happen good idea include least true input true file allow program receive input even forget ask see next item subject trouble cut work xterm include sun program need add follow either file instead xterm must move mouse end press key already file work check set either set line see also environment version put xterm onto xterm primary primary note sure end line must follow space sign show faq file must also remove use may find add line primary line make cut work cut key instead must use call specific resource name include sun program xterm sun key left keyboard use cut change key add follow two line file wish value show default list resource manual page also blue book volume reference manual also manual page always get piece text press remove file see help see also next item cut copy work oh use ps check run either root start depend whether start start die check may need root remove workstation check space use also see lot file name like several hundred cut may take long time tool start terminal remove file still start cut break start work carry note file might use another remove without check first subject trouble use display get error message look like xlib connection refuse server xlib internal error connection check error open display try machine run machine machine computer run command fail want let user run program machine use display type name workstation let user access display also use programmer guide describe chapter secure also check man page stop user access directly also note sun patch fix serious security problem available local sun answer center well anonymous ftp system fix terminal may setup menu let change list host access display start get message might job remove unix use server display system change subject trouble common problem get error message screen go away sun make message new one come along later need run xterm start one background choose save menu better still pick run get directory monitor open message appear easy menu make message go away sun frame buffer two screen move mouse default edge screen onto whole new display call see man page shell check run might need add file display unix display unix later release also run get message also see note easy way use appear default root menu property start property editor remove comment apply change keep comment use comment instead example comment font get file manager use instead set default editor font file change font prefer smaller one run video tend work various way include use option use sun probably best short upgrade workstation use xterm instead work bug may make guide output use guide output guide output break actual code apply version still use upgrade soon possible new one leave screen go mouse stay screen try run help put last line shell use start use system crash server hang something bug related system use screen program function key stop work change application must might able use public domain program change keyboard back type get version see trouble strange error message see also next item mix see also next item note include distribution patch level directory note apply although also sort thing install library compatible respect put binary example put last

version get error message program message generally see next item although right set directory contain see also environment especially get error message screen find set also use use put shell use instead different launch get map error system need patch look install patch run must run use run terminal anything else use news draw postscript text picture use need use compatible call user use replace old one first sense binary also note datum file postscript look fix version available ftp choice window menu implement yet many program respond key though menu file break true use xterm instead fine also work run command tool remote machine fix ship run program widget red release add operation action widget select via keyboard currently select item red red show input focus place add

window system push color end colormap reserve also note lock color current window describe manual page use wrong color make colormap see problem report people reason run motif window manager try run like break thing command tool like run without unix terminal use start command tool well application may need run set necessary environment variable note mit start server root security hole use aware user access file start unix process root function key stop work name key change code use might able get away subject trouble problem section faq appear promise reach note also usenet newsgroup although wide distribution order one two article per month also look faq set font individual list item take int take null list easy way make entire list fix font make sure always specify new list write function list string hide bit keep window display button press button button null keep window visible might also need make button look press call document source work properly greg patch apply note get right example patch little bug mine else else file install file install file note patch new line subject environment environment variable value use list take account local change might make course list difference add comment user display name windows display use local machine one actually run machine second screen machine may need let program machine use display see also trouble see
