article tom write robert write wonder possible use radio wave measure distance yes call radar well actually quite radar measure distance measure time require signal receive target radar generally use radio use either transmission case highly accurate distance make example original radio accurate foot foot note however different method measure poster originally ask problem gain accurate need highly accurate time base start exact wire connect since radio wave actually travel faster air case wire difference call factor cable need common correct distance something like connect sound expensive bad plan spend equipment effort go different method use system time measure try sound like something know anyway seem able measure signal determine distance short distance need inch actually highly since power output vary unit unit transmission line may also vary unit unit unit time need entire system radio also since everything one place much easier note especially time base one unit also depend environment yes environment object move kill concept effect say signal win unless two signal db signal one problem make low signal tend strong frequency best matter high possible eliminate outside also signal radio use frequency around hope help jack radio internet
