modify quadra higher speed previously use variable speed cpu test higher speed may vary top speed achieve predict hand personal test fine mhz thus far higher speed clock hand test higher speed clock pin variety need speed begin mhz cpu run speed original one mhz unit recommend get mhz clock case damage exist one obtain clock less part number mhz clock part mhz clock part mhz clock part get half size clock fit also clock try one quadra work fine obtain pin form factor pin package use pin style cut cool fan small fan keep cpu cool must come modify fan build onto connector hard drive power cable something similar risk cpu procedure usual disclaimer warning remove top machine see floppy disk hard drive mount follow usual course make sure machine cable wall monitor power supply back mac remove power supply pull forward pull power supply straight piece left aspect extend power supply may also feel piece right power supply leave alone need release look rear see scsi connector hard drive power cable cable lead floppy drive motherboard hard drive power cable connector must release drive activity lead clear mount look section head screw base remove take care drop case bit helpful remove pull right side prevent entire straight case remove switch device left front edge motherboard pull middle rear forward entire device release speaker cable speaker free free case remove motherboard form case front right corner motherboard allow clear clear power light guide motherboard forward motherboard come directly mhz clock small box near cpu chip note remember new clock must pin remove old clock pin may simply sure hot enough heat board use task appropriate first experience motherboard design fine easily damage without proper care install pin old put mhz clock new use old clock pin may come inside cause problem later suggest use new mhz clock install fan system complete motherboard place switch speaker lock mother board plug speaker wire back motherboard first place right wall right wall case position lower place maintain contact right wall case fully place motherboard end cable forget floppy drive cable replace head screw drop power supply straight place plug hard drive activity light back clear mount cable power cross finger turn mac make usual power something immediately turn power well work normally turn machine back replace mhz clock faster one need fully test machine many hour decide particular speed truly machine might take hour operation occur time since modify clock hour single problem good luck attempt small real risk well reach quadra speed higher less part guy
